Win, Loss, Tie counter displayed
Game asks you rock, paper, scissors or quit
if you win
  tells you you win and adds 1 to the win counter
  goes back to asking you between rock, paper, scissor and quit
if you lose
  tells you you lost and adds 1 to the lose counter
  goes back to asking you between rock, paper, scissor and quit
if you tie
  tells you that you tied and adds 1 to the tie counter
  goes back to asking you between rock, paper, scissor and quit
if you quit
  ends game

make sure that always loops back to input after each round (need an infinite loop or a continue would do it too, but infinite loop is easier)
