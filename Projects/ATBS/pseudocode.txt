collatz pseudocode:
take an integer from the user
evaluate whether integer is odd or even first
if integer is even
  integer == integer // 2
  return this value as a new variable
if integer is odd
  integer == integer * 3 + 1
  return this value as a new variable
run these new variables through the collatz until the number 1 is returned
  if number == 1:
  sys.exit()

Dice Game:
First thing will be that we ask the user if they want to roll the Dice
if they say yes:
  return two values each between 1-6 and randomly generated
if they say no:
  thank them
